There are four main scripts to run:
- `random_agent.py`: Initial random agent implementation.
- `random_agent_bellman_function.py`: Random agent implementation with Bellman's function.
- `qlearning_agent.py`: Agent implemented using the Q-Learning algorithm.
- `sarsa_agent.py`: Agent implemented using the SARSA algorithm.

### Q-Learning:

A reinforcement learning technique where the agent learns to act in a way that maximizes the expected reward over time.

### SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action):

An on-policy control technique where the agent learns to evaluate actions in the environment based on actual rewards received.
